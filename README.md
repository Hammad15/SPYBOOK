# SPYBOOK

## Project Description
Spybook is a social game in which the main goal of the users, the players, is to hack other users. Each player has several aliases created by themselves, and several contracts generated by the website. Each contract specifies another player who is to be “hacked” to complete the contract. There is a world map using which players can move between locations and find their targets. A successful “Hacking” reveals the target’s alias and grants a level-up to the successful hacker and completion of a contract. An unsuccessful “Hacking” reveals the hacker’s alias to the public and reduces a level.

OR
* Install any IDE(s) compatible with Java and JavaScript
* Download the backend and frontend code using the command:
* Backend:
    * git clone https://github.com/2011Canada/project-2-team5-backend.git
    * update the maven project to install all dependencies
    * set the "ddl-auto" to "create" in the application.yml file in /src/main/resources
    * run the file Project2Application.java in src/main/java/com/revature/project2
    * set the "ddl-auto" back to "validate"
* Frontend:
    * git clone https://github.com/2011Canada/project-2-team5-frontend.git  
    * navigate to directory containing the cloned repo
    * run `npm install` to install all dependencies
    * run `npm start` to launch the website

* From the main page, go to the profile page to view all your aliases and your current alias. You will also find an option to create an alias there.
* Next, navigate to the contracts page to get a contract and come back to main page to begin hacking!
* You can go back to the profile page to check that the level of your alias has changed after a hack operation.
